Q26. What is a string? How can we declare string in Python?
Strings are Kind of arrays which are declared in single doubleor tripple quotes. Ex -> a = 'Prashant Goel'

Q27. How can we access the string using its index?
By specifying the index number in square brackets. Ex -> print(a[1]) ----> This will give output 'r'

Q28. Write a code to get the desired output of the following

string = "Big Data iNeuron"
desired_output = "iNeuron"

print(string[-7:])

Q29. Write a code to get the desired output of the following

string = "Big Data iNeuron"
desired_output = "norueNi"

print(string[:-8:-1])

Q30. Resverse the string given in the above question.
print(string[::-1])

Q31. How can you delete entire string at once?
Using del keyword. Ex -> del string

Q32. What is escape sequence?
An escape sequence is a sequence of characters that, when used inside a character or string, does not represent itself but is converted into another character or series of characters.  Ex-> print('Who's this?') will give syntax error so we can use --> print('Who\'s this?')

Q33. How can you print the below string?

'iNeuron's Big Data Course'

print('iNeuron\'s Big Data Course')

Q34. What is a list in Python?
Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable. 

Q35. How can you create a list in Python?
These are created using square brackets. 
Ex -> list1 = ["Prashant","Shashank","Vishal"]
list2 = [1,2,3]

Q36. How can we access the elements in a list?
We can access them by referring to the index number.
Ex -> print(list1[1])

Q37. Write a code to access the word "iNeuron" from the given list.

lst = [1,2,3,"Hi",[45,54, "iNeuron"], "Big Data"]
print(lst[4][2])

Q38. Take a list as an input from the user and find the length of the list.
lst = []
n = int(input("Enter number of elements : "))
for i in range(0, n):
    ele = int(input())
    lst.append(ele)
print(len(lst))

Q39. Add the word "Big" in the 3rd index of the given list.

lst = ["Welcome", "to", "Data", "course"]
lst.insert(2,"Big")

Q40. What is a tuple? How is it different from list?
Tuples are also used to store multiple items in a single variable but it is not mutable wheras lists are mutable.

Q41. How can you create a tuple in Python?
Tuples are written with round brackets.
Ex-> tpl = ("Prashant","Shashank","Vishal")

Q42. Create a tuple and try to add your name in the tuple. Are you able to do it? Support your answer with reason.
Not possible since it is a property of tuple that it is not mutable.

Q43. Can two tuple be appended. If yes, write a code for it. If not, why?
Yes. ex-> 
tp1=(1,2) 
tp2=(3,4)
tp3=tp1+tp2

Q44. Take a tuple as an input and print the count of elements in it.
tpl4 = tuple(input("Enter : ").split())
leng = len(tpl4)
print(leng)

Q45. What are sets in Python?
A set is a collection which is unordered, unchangeable*, and unindexed.

Q46. How can you create a set?
Sets are written with curly brackets.
set1 = {"Prashant","Shashank","Vishal"}

Q47. Create a set and add "iNeuron" in your set.
set1.add("iNeuron")

Q48. Try to add multiple values using add() function.
Gave error.

Q49. How is update() different from add()?
To add items from another set into the current set, we use the update() method.

Q50. What is clear() in sets?
The clear() method empties the set.

Q51. What is frozen set?
It creates an immutable Set object from an iterable. It is a built-in Python function. As it is a set object therefore we cannot have duplicate values in the frozenset.

Q52. How is frozen set different from set?
Set is mutable and hashable whereas Frozenset is not.And there are very limited functions we can use with frozenset.

Q53. What is union() in sets? Explain via code.
Union of two given sets is the set which contains all the elements of both the sets.
Ex -> 
A = {2, 4, 5, 6}
B = {4, 6, 7, 8}
print("A U B:", A.union(B))

Q54. What is intersection() in sets? Explain via code.
The intersection of two given sets is the largest set, which contains all the elements that are common to both sets.
Ex->
s1 = {1, 2, 3}
s2 = {2, 3}
print(s1.intersection(s2))

Q55. What is dictionary ibn Python?
Dictionaries are used to store data values in key:value pairs.
A dictionary is a collection which is ordered, changeable and do not allow duplicates.
Dictionaries are written with curly brackets.

Q56. How is dictionary different from all other data structures.
It stores values in key:value pairs which no other data structure in python does.

Q57. How can we delare a dictionary in Python?
We can create a dictionary using the dict() function.

Q58. What will the output of the following?
var = {}
print(type(var))

class 'dict'

Q59. How can we add an element in a dictionary?
tdict["car"] = "Aventador"
This will add key as car and its value as Urus in an existing dictionary 'dict'.

Q60. Create a dictionary and access all the values in that dictionary.
dict1 = {
  "brand": "Lamborghini",
  "model": "Urus",
  "year": 2020
}
print(dict1)

Q61. Create a nested dictionary and access all the element in the inner dictionary.
dict1 = {
  "brand": "Lamborghini",
  "model": "Urus",
  "year": 2020,
  "dict2" : {"Name":"Prashant","age":23}
}

print(dict1["dict2"])


Q62. What is the use of get() function?
The get() method returns the value of the item with the specified key.

Q63. What is the use of items() function?
The items() method returns a view object. The view object contains the key-value pairs of the dictionary, as tuples in a list.
The view object will reflect any changes done to the dictionary.

Q64. What is the use of pop() function?
The pop() method removes the item with the specified key name.

Q65. What is the use of popitems() function?
The popitem() method removes the last inserted item.

Q66. What is the use of keys() function?
The keys() method will return a list of all the keys in the dictionary.

Q67. What is the use of values() function?
The values() method will return a list of all the values in the dictionary.

Q68. What are loops in Python?
Loop statements allows us to execute a statement or group of statements multiple times.

Q69. How many type of loop are there in Python?
for loop and while loop

Q70. What is the difference between for and while loops?
For loop allows a programmer to execute a sequence of statements several times, it abbreviates the code which helps to manage loop variables.
While loop allows a programmer to repeat a single statement or a group of statements for the TRUE condition. It verifies the condition before executing the loop.
